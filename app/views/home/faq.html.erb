                                <p>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a scientific, evidence-based approach that uses principles of learning and behavior to bring about meaningful and positive change. ABA breaks down complex skills into smaller, teachable steps and uses positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors while reducing challenging ones through systematic interventions. Each program is customized based on comprehensive assessments, focusing on the individual's strengths, challenges, and family goals for maximum effectiveness.</p>
